# Cordova/PhoneGap SQLitePlugin

Native interface to sqlite in a Cordova/PhoneGap plugin for Android/iOS/WP(8), with API similar to HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/).

License for Android & WP(8) versions: MIT or Apache 2.0

License for iOS version: MIT only

## Status

- [Available at PhoneGap build](https://build.phonegap.com/plugins/2368)

## Announcements

- [SQLCipher](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/) for Android & iOS is now supported by [brodysoft / Cordova-sqlcipher-adaptor](https://github.com/brodysoft/Cordova-sqlcipher-adaptor)
- New `openDatabase` and `deleteDatabase` `location` option to select database location (iOS *only*) and disable iCloud backup
- Pre-populated databases support for Android & iOS is now integrated, usage described below
- Fixes to work with PouchDB by [@nolanlawson](https://github.com/nolanlawson)

## Highlights

- Works with Cordova 3.x tooling and [available at PhoneGap build](https://build.phonegap.com/plugins/2368)
- Drop-in replacement for HTML5 SQL API, the only change should be `window.openDatabase()` --> `sqlitePlugin.openDatabase()`
- Failure-safe nested transactions with batch processing optimizations
- As described in [this posting](http://brodyspark.blogspot.com/2012/12/cordovaphonegap-sqlite-plugins-offer.html):
  - Keeps sqlite database in a user data location that is known, can be reconfigured, and iOS will be backed up by iCloud.
  - No 5MB maximum, more information at: http://www.sqlite.org/limits.html
- Android is supported back to SDK 10 (a.k.a. Gingerbread, Android 2.3.3); Support for older versions is available upon request.
- Pre-populated database option (usage described below)

## Some apps using Cordova/PhoneGap SQLitePlugin

## Known issues

- Issue reported with PhoneGap Build Hydration.
- Using web workers is currently not supported and known to be broken on Android.
- Triggers are only supported for iOS, known to be broken on Android.
- INSERT statement that affects multiple rows (due to SELECT cause or using triggers, for example) does not report proper rowsAffected on Android.

## Other limitations

- The db version, display name, and size parameter values are not supported and will be ignored.
- The sqlite plugin will not work before the callback for the "deviceready" event has been fired, as described in **Usage**.
- The Android version cannot work with more than 100 open db files due to its threading model.
- UNICODE line separator (`\u2028`) is currently not supported and known to be broken in iOS version.
- UNICODE characters not working with WP(8) version

## Limited support (testing needed)

- Multi-page apps on WP(8)
- DB Triggers (as described above - known to be broken for Android)

## Other versions

- [pull request #157](https://github.com/brodysoft/Cordova-SQLitePlugin/pull/157) - contribution of a Windows version in C# with proper transaction support (manual installation required)
- [brodysoft / Cordova-sqlcipher-adaptor](https://github.com/brodysoft/Cordova-sqlcipher-adaptor) - supports [SQLCipher](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/) for Android & iOS
- Original version for iOS (with a different API): [davibe / Phonegap-SQLitePlugin](https://github.com/davibe/Phonegap-SQLitePlugin)

## Other SQLite adapter projects

- [EionRobb / phonegap-win8-sqlite](https://github.com/EionRobb/phonegap-win8-sqlite) - WebSQL add-on for Win8/Metro apps (perhaps with a different API), using an old version of the C++ library from [SQLite3-WinRT Component](https://github.com/doo/SQLite3-WinRT) (as referenced by [01org / cordova-win8](https://github.com/01org/cordova-win8))
- [SQLite3-WinRT Component](https://github.com/doo/SQLite3-WinRT) - C++ component that provides a nice SQLite API with promises for WinJS
- [01org / cordova-win8](https://github.com/01org/cordova-win8) - old, unofficial version of Cordova API support for Windows 8 Metro that includes an old version of the C++ [SQLite3-WinRT Component](https://github.com/doo/SQLite3-WinRT)
- [MSOpenTech / cordova-plugin-websql](https://github.com/MSOpenTech/cordova-plugin-websql) - Windows 8(+) and Windows Phone 8(+) WebSQL plugin versions in C#
- [MetaMemoryT / websql-client](https://github.com/MetaMemoryT/websql-client) - provides the same API and connects to [websql-server](https://github.com/MetaMemoryT/websql-server) through WebSockets.

# Usage

The idea is to emulate the HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/) as closely as possible. The only major change is to use `window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase()` (or `sqlitePlugin.openDatabase()`) instead of `window.openDatabase()`. If you see any other major change please report it, it is probably a bug.

## Opening a database

There are two options to open a database:
- Recommended: `var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db", location: 1});`
- Classical: `var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase("myDatabase.db", "1.0", "Demo", -1);`

The new `location` option is used to select the database subdirectory location (iOS *only*) with the following choices:
- `0` (default): `Documents` - will be visible to iTunes and backed up by iCloud
- `1`: `Library` - backed up by iCloud, *NOT* visible to iTunes
- `2`: `Library/LocalDatabase` - *NOT* visible to iTunes and *NOT* backed up by iCloud

**IMPORTANT:** Please wait for the "deviceready" event, as in the following example:

```js
// Wait for Cordova to load
document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);

// Cordova is ready
function onDeviceReady() {
  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db"});
  // ...
}
```

**NOTE:** The database file name should include the extension, if desired.

### Workaround for Android db locking issue

An [issue was reported](https://github.com/brodysoft/Cordova-SQLitePlugin/issues/193), as observed by several people that on some newer versions of the Android, if the app is stopped or aborted without closing the db then:
- (sometimes) there is an unexpected db lock
- the data that was inserted before is lost.

It is suspected that this issue is caused by [this Android sqlite commit](https://github.com/android/platform_external_sqlite/commit/d4f30d0d1544f8967ee5763c4a1680cb0553039f), which references and includes the sqlite commit at: http://www.sqlite.org/src/info/6c4c2b7dba

There is an optional workaround that simply closes and reopens the database file at the end of every transaction that is committed. The workaround is enabled by opening the database like:

```js
var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db", androidLockWorkaround: 1});
```

**NOTE:** This workaround is *only* applied when using `db.transaction()` or `db.readTransaction()`, *not* applied when running `executeSql()` on the database object.

### Pre-populated database

For Android & iOS (*only*): put the database file in the `www` directory and open the database like:

```js
var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db", createFromLocation: 1});
```

or to disable iCloud backup:

```js
db = sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db", location: 2, createFromLocation: 1});
```

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- Put the pre-populated database file in the `www` subdirectory. This should work well with using the Cordova CLI to support both Android & iOS versions.
- The pre-populated database file name must match **exactly** the file name given in `openDatabase`. The automatic extension has been completely eliminated.
- The pre-populated database file is ignored if the database file with the same name already exists in your database file location.

**TIP:** If you don't see the data from the pre-populated database file, completely remove your app and try it again!

## Background processing

The threading model depends on which version is used:
- For Android & WP(8), one background thread per db;
- for iOS, background processing using a thread pool.

# Sample with PRAGMA feature

This is a pretty strong test: first we create a table and add a single entry, then query the count to check if the item was inserted as expected. Note that a new transaction is created in the middle of the first callback.

```js
// Wait for Cordova to load
document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);

// Cordova is ready
function onDeviceReady() {
  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db"});

  db.transaction(function(tx) {
    tx.executeSql('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test_table');
    tx.executeSql('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test_table (id integer primary key, data text, data_num integer)');

    // demonstrate PRAGMA:
    db.executeSql("pragma table_info (test_table);", [], function(res) {
      console.log("PRAGMA res: " + JSON.stringify(res));
    });

    tx.executeSql("INSERT INTO test_table (data, data_num) VALUES (?,?)", ["test", 100], function(tx, res) {
      console.log("insertId: " + res.insertId + " -- probably 1");
      console.log("rowsAffected: " + res.rowsAffected + " -- should be 1");

      db.transaction(function(tx) {
        tx.executeSql("select count(id) as cnt from test_table;", [], function(tx, res) {
          console.log("res.rows.length: " + res.rows.length + " -- should be 1");
          console.log("res.rows.item(0).cnt: " + res.rows.item(0).cnt + " -- should be 1");
        });
      });

    }, function(e) {
      console.log("ERROR: " + e.message);
    });
  });
}
```

## Sample with transaction-level nesting

In this case, the same transaction in the first executeSql() callback is being reused to run executeSql() again.

```js
// Wait for Cordova to load
document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);

// Cordova is ready
function onDeviceReady() {
  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase("Database", "1.0", "Demo", -1);

  db.transaction(function(tx) {
    tx.executeSql('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test_table');
    tx.executeSql('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test_table (id integer primary key, data text, data_num integer)');

    tx.executeSql("INSERT INTO test_table (data, data_num) VALUES (?,?)", ["test", 100], function(tx, res) {
      console.log("insertId: " + res.insertId + " -- probably 1");
      console.log("rowsAffected: " + res.rowsAffected + " -- should be 1");

      tx.executeSql("select count(id) as cnt from test_table;", [], function(tx, res) {
        console.log("res.rows.length: " + res.rows.length + " -- should be 1");
        console.log("res.rows.item(0).cnt: " + res.rows.item(0).cnt + " -- should be 1");
      });

    }, function(e) {
      console.log("ERROR: " + e.message);
    });
  });
}
```

This case will also works with Safari (WebKit), assuming you replace `window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase` with `window.openDatabase`.

## Delete a database

```js
window.sqlitePlugin.deleteDatabase({name: "my.db", location: 1}, successcb, errorcb);
```

`location` as described above for `openDatabase` (iOS *only*)

# Installing

## Easy install with plugman tool

```shell
plugman install --platform MYPLATFORM --project path.to.my.project.folder --plugin https://github.com/brodysoft/Cordova-SQLitePlugin
```

where MYPLATFORM is `android`, `ios`, or `wp8`.

Here is a posting how to get started on Windows without the Cordova CLI tool: http://brodybits.blogspot.com/2015/03/trying-cordova-for-android-on-windows-without-cordova-cli.html

## Easy install with Cordova CLI tool

    npm install -g cordova # if you don't have cordova
    cordova create MyProjectFolder com.my.project MyProject && cd MyProjectFolder # if you are just starting
    cordova plugin add https://github.com/brodysoft/Cordova-SQLitePlugin

You can find more details at [this writeup](http://iphonedevlog.wordpress.com/2014/04/07/installing-chris-brodys-sqlite-database-with-cordova-cli-android/).

**IMPORTANT:** sometimes you have to update the version for a platform before you can build, like: `cordova prepare ios`

**NOTE:** If you cannot build for a platform after `cordova prepare`, you may have to remove the platform and add it again, such as:

    cordova platform rm ios
    cordova platform add ios

## Source tree

- `SQLitePlugin.coffee.md`: platform-independent (Literate coffee-script, can be read by recent coffee-script compiler)
- `www`: `SQLitePlugin.js` now platform-independent
- `src`: Java plugin code for Android; Objective-C plugin code for iOS; C-sharp code & DLLs for WP(8)
- `test-www`: simple testing in `index.html` using qunit 1.5.0
- `Lawnchair-adapter`: Lawnchair adaptor, based on the version from the Lawnchair repository, with the basic Lawnchair test suite in `test-www` subdirectory

## Manual installation - Android version

These installation instructions are based on the Android example project from Cordova/PhoneGap 2.7.0. For your first time please unzip the PhoneGap 2.7 zipball and use the `lib/android/example` subdirectory.

 - Install www/SQLitePlugin.js from this repository into assets/www subdirectory
 - Install src/android/org/pgsqlite/SQLitePlugin.java from this repository into src/org/pgsqlite subdirectory
 - Add the plugin element `<plugin name="SQLitePlugin" value="org.pgsqlite.SQLitePlugin"/>` to res/xml/config.xml

Sample change to res/xml/config.xml for Cordova/PhoneGap 2.x:

     <plugin name="Device" value="org.apache.cordova.Device"/>
```

Before building for the first time, you have to update the project with the desired version of the Android SDK with a command like:

    android update project --path $(pwd) --target android-17

(assume Android SDK 17, use the correct desired Android SDK number here)

**NOTE:** using this plugin on Cordova pre-3.0 requires the following change to SQLitePlugin.java:

## Manual installation - iOS version

### SQLite library

In the Project "Build Phases" tab, select the _first_ "Link Binary with Libraries" dropdown menu and add the library `libsqlite3.dylib` or `libsqlite3.0.dylib`.

**NOTE:** In the "Build Phases" there can be multiple "Link Binary with Libraries" dropdown menus. Please select the first one otherwise it will not work.

### SQLite Plugin

Drag .h and .m files into your project's Plugins folder (in xcode) -- I always
just have "Create references" as the option selected.

Take the precompiled javascript file from build/, or compile the coffeescript
file in src/ to javascript WITH the top-level function wrapper option (default).

Use the resulting javascript file in your HTML.

Enable the SQLitePlugin in `config.xml` (Cordova/PhoneGap 2.x):

# Common traps & pitfalls

- The plugin class name starts with "SQL" in capital letters, but in Javascript the `sqlitePlugin` object name starts with "sql" in small letters.
- Attempting to open a database before receiving the "deviceready" event callback.

# Support

## Reporting issues

If you have an issue with the plugin please check the following first:
- You are using the latest version of the Plugin Javascript & platform-specific Java or Objective-C source from this repository.
- You have installed the Javascript & platform-specific Java or Objective-C correctly.
- You have included the correct version of the cordova Javascript and SQLitePlugin.js and got the path right.
- You have registered the plugin properly in `config.xml`.

If you still cannot get something to work:
- Make the simplest test program you can to demonstrate the issue, including the following characteristics:
  - it completely self-contained, i.e. it is using no extra libraries beyond cordova & SQLitePlugin.js;
  - if the issue is with *adding* data to a table, that the test program includes the statements you used to open the database and create the table;
  - if the issue is with *retrieving* data from a table, that the test program includes the statements you used to open the database, create the table, and enter the data you are trying to retrieve.

Then you can [raise the new issue](https://github.com/brodysoft/Cordova-SQLitePlugin/issues/new).

## Community forum

If you have any questions about the plugin please post it to the [Cordova-SQLitePlugin forum](http://groups.google.com/group/Cordova-SQLitePlugin).

**NOTE:** Please report all bugs at [brodysoft / Cordova-SQLitePlugin / issues](https://github.com/brodysoft/Cordova-SQLitePlugin/issues) so they can be tracked properly.

# Unit tests

Unit testing is done in `test-www/`.

## running tests from shell

To run the tests from \*nix shell, simply do either:
 
    ./bin/test.sh ios

or for Android:

    ./bin/test.sh android

To run then from a windows powershell do either

    .\bin\test.ps1 android

or for Windows Phone 8:

    .\bin\test.ps1 wp8

# Adapters

## Lawnchair Adapter

### Common adapter

Please look at the `Lawnchair-adapter` tree that contains a common adapter, which should also work with the Android version, along with a test-www directory.

### Included files

Include the following Javascript files in your HTML:

- `cordova.js` (don't forget!)
- `lawnchair.js` (you provide)
- `SQLitePlugin.js` (in case of Cordova pre-3.0)
- `Lawnchair-sqlitePlugin.js` (must come after `SQLitePlugin.js` in case of Cordova pre-3.0)

### Sample

The `name` option will determine the sqlite database filename, *with no extension automatically added*. Optionally, you can change it using the `db` option.

In this example, you would be using/creating a database with filename `kvstore`:

```Javascript
kvstore = new Lawnchair({name: "kvstore"}, function() {
  // do stuff
);
```

Using the `db` option you can specify the filename with the desired extension and be able to create multiple stores in the same database file. (There will be one table per store.)

```Javascript
recipes = new Lawnchair({db: "cookbook", name: "recipes", ...}, myCallback());
ingredients = new Lawnchair({db: "cookbook", name: "ingredients", ...}, myCallback());
```

**KNOWN ISSUE:** the new db options are *not* supported by the Lawnchair adapter. The workaround is to first open the database file using `sqlitePlugin.openDatabase()`.

## PouchDB

The adapter is now part of [PouchDB](http://pouchdb.com/) thanks to [@nolanlawson](https://github.com/nolanlawson), see [PouchDB FAQ](http://pouchdb.com/faq.html).

# Contributing

**WARNING:** Please do NOT propose changes from your `master` branch. In general changes will be rebased using `git rebase` or `git cherry-pick` and not merged.

- Testimonials of apps that are using this plugin would be especially helpful.
- Reporting issues at [brodysoft / Cordova-SQLitePlugin / issues](https://github.com/brodysoft/Cordova-SQLitePlugin/issues) can help improve the quality of this plugin.
- Patches with bug fixes are helpful, especially when submitted with test code.
- Other enhancements welcome for consideration, when submitted with test code and will work for all supported platforms. Increase of complexity should be avoided.
- All contributions may be reused by [@brodybits (Chris Brody)](https://github.com/brodybits) under another license in the future. Efforts will be taken to give credit for major contributions but it will not be guaranteed.
- Project restructuring, i.e. moving files and/or directories around, should be avoided if possible. If you see a need for restructuring, it is best to ask first on the [Cordova-SQLitePlugin forum](http://groups.google.com/group/Cordova-SQLitePlugin) where alternatives can be discussed before reaching a conclusion. If you want to propose a change to the project structure:
  - Make a special branch within your fork from which you can send the proposed restructuring;
  - Always use `git mv` to move files & directories;
  - Never mix a move/rename operation and any other changes in the same commit.

## Major branches

- `common-src` - source for Android & iOS versions
- `master-src` - source for Android, iOS, & WP(8) versions
- `master-rc` - pre-release version, including source for CSharp-SQLite library classes
- `master` - version for release, will be included in PhoneGap build.
